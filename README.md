MP3 Streams Reloaded

### Notes
  * Pagination is in context menu where needed
  * Force fixed viewmode in settings if needed (default ids for Confluence, other skins will be different)
  * Seeking is not possible (server side)
  * Try not to queue everything at once, one album/artist at a time should be fine.
  * PAPlayer can crash Kodi if something goes wrong with stream/server
